  * IMPORTANT: Backward incompatible syntax change: '{...}' and '[...]' are not

    if you want to wrap code with spaces. This allows to write arrays and hashes directly.
    Old:
       div id={'obj' + name} data=({:a => 1, :b => 2}) class=['alpha', 'beta']
    New:
       div id=('obj' + name) data={:a => 1, :b => 2} class=['alpha', 'beta']
  * Quoted attributes are escaped by default
    Old:
       a href='http://slim-lang.com/?a=1&amp;b=2'
    New:
       a href='http://slim-lang.com/?a=1&b=2'
       a href=='http://slim-lang.com/?a=1&amp;b=2'
    You can always disable escaping completly by using :disable_escape if you don't want to write '=='.
  * Added hyphenation support for data attributes (Option :hyphen_attrs)
    Example: div data={key1_key2: 2, key1: {key3: 3}} will render as '<div data-key1-key2="2" data-key1-key3="3"></div>'
  * Removed deprecated options:
    - :escape_quoted_attrs

    curly braces and brackets will be interpreted as Hash/Array in Slim 2.0.0
    Old syntax:
      div id={person && person.id}
      div id=[person && person.id]
    New syntax in 2.0.0:
      div id=(person && person.id)
  * Deprecated :escape_quoted_attrs (done by default in 2.0)
  * Warn if quoted attributes might be double escaped in Slim 2.0.0
    Old syntax:
       a href='http://slim-lang.com/?a=1&amp;b=2'
       a href=='http://slim-lang.com/?a=1&amp;b=2'
    New syntax in 2.0.0:

  * Code restructured - Handling of boolean and splat attributes improved and PERFORMANCE improved.

    (this means "" is now interpreted as true), whereas false and nil are still removed.
    This corresponds to the definition of boolean attributes in XHTML and HTML5.
  * Deprecated option :remove_empty_attrs (TODO: Remove in 1.4.0)
  * Add option :escape_quoted_attrs to escape quoted attributes, use == if you don't want that.
