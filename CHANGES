  * Support inline html at the beginning of a line (New line indicator <). No pipe symbol is | necessary.
    It is even possible to wrap other Slim syntax in such a html block.
  * Code restructured - Handling of boolean and splat attributes improved and PERFORMANCE improved.
  * BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE -  Dynamic attributes which return empty value "" are not removed anymore
    (this means "" is now interpreted as true), whereas false and nil are still removed.
    This corresponds to the definition of boolean attributes in XHTML and HTML5.
  * Deprecated option :remove_empty_attrs (TODO: Remove in 1.4.0)
  * Add option :escape_quoted_attrs to escape quoted attributes, use == if you don't want that.
    The default is false to stay backward compatible.
  * Use Temple::FilterError exception
  * Use Temple::Parser
  * / is not escaped anymore to &#47;
  * Parser: check for missing closing quote in quoted attributes
  * Use new temple option validation to make Slim configuration more user friendly.
  * Support thread options Slim::Engine.with_options which especially useful for Rails
  * Add explicit column number to SyntaxError.to_s

    Define custom shortcut attribute (e.g. a@ajax-link renders <a role="ajax-link"></a>)
      Slim::Parser.default_options[:shortcut] = {'@' => 'role'}
    Define custom shortcut attribute with tag (e.g. @ajax-link renders <a role="ajax-link"></a>)
      Slim::Parser.default_options[:shortcut] = {'@' => 'a role'}
