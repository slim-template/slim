# The behavior of RuboCop can be controlled via the .rubocop.yml
# configuration file. It makes it possible to enable/disable
# certain cops (checks) and to alter their behavior if they accept
# any parameters. The file can be placed either in your home
# directory or in some project directory.
#
# RuboCop will start looking for the configuration file in the directory
# where the inspected file is and continue its way up to the root directory.
#
# See https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration
